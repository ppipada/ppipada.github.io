Based on the descriptions provided, here is a possible categorization of the teams according to the team topologies approach:

Stream-aligned teams:
Phoenix: Delivers data protection for servers, VMs, databases, NAS boxes
Cloudranger: Delivers data protection for AWS, Azure resources like VMs and database services in the public cloud
Endpoints: Delivers data protection for endpoints like laptops or personal desktops
Saasapp: Delivers data protection for SaaS-based apps like M365, Salesforce
All of these teams are focused on delivering value to specific streams or products, and are organized around a clear purpose. They are all stream-aligned teams.

Complicated-subsystem team:
Daintree: Provides the snapshotting filesystem to dump the data to be protected
Daintree provides a critical technical component that is used by the other teams. As such, it can be categorized as a complicated-subsystem team.

Enabling teams:
Shared services control: Provides services to be used by everyone else for scheduling, instance load balancing, license management, authorization of different identities, consumer agent management, job management, stats storage
Shared services data: Provides services to be used by any other service or directly by the user for metadata search, batch processing pipeline, data lake
Both Shared services control and Shared services data provide shared services that help streamline the delivery process for the other teams. They can be categorized as enabling teams.

Platform team:
Cloud platform: Handles authentication, console for a user, external communication like alert integrations with third-party services
The Cloud platform team is responsible for developing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and platforms that enable all other teams to deliver software effectively. As such, it can be categorized as a platform team.

Feature team:
Realize: Gives ransomware recovery, proactive compliance, legal hold, ediscovery capabilities on the data being protected
The description provided for Realize suggests that it is focused on delivering a specific feature or set of features rather than a stream or product. As such, it can be categorized as a feature team.

Overall, this categorization is just one possible way of organizing the teams according to the team topologies approach. Depending on the specific context of the organization and its software delivery needs, a different team division may be more appropriate.




Certainly! Here's an explanation for each service and why I categorized them as an enabling team or platform team:

Shared Services Control:

Scheduling: I categorized scheduling as an enabling team because it provides support and functionality that enables other teams to deliver their software more effectively. For example, teams may use the scheduling service to schedule tasks or jobs for their software to run at a specific time or interval. This functionality enables teams to automate tasks and improve the efficiency of their software development process.
Instance load balancing: I categorized instance load balancing as an enabling team for similar reasons as scheduling. The load balancing service provides support and functionality that enables other teams to deliver their software more effectively. For example, teams may use the load balancing service to distribute traffic across multiple instances of their software to improve performance and availability.
License management: I categorized license management as an enabling team because it provides support and functionality that enables other teams to manage their software licenses more effectively. For example, teams may use the license management service to track and manage their software licenses, ensuring they are in compliance with licensing agreements and avoiding any legal or financial penalties.
Authorization of different identities: I categorized authorization of different identities as an enabling team because it provides support and functionality that enables other teams to manage access to their software more effectively. For example, teams may use the authorization service to manage access to their software based on a user's identity or role, ensuring that only authorized users can access their software.
Consumer agent management: I categorized consumer agent management as an enabling team because it provides support and functionality that enables other teams to manage their software agents more effectively. For example, teams may use the agent management service to deploy and manage software agents across different environments, ensuring that their software is properly configured and functioning as expected.
Job management: I categorized job management as an enabling team for similar reasons as scheduling. The job management service provides support and functionality that enables other teams to automate tasks and improve the efficiency of their software development process.
Stats storage: I categorized stats storage as an enabling team because it provides support and functionality that enables other teams to monitor and analyze the performance of their software. For example, teams may use the stats storage service to collect and store metrics about their software's performance, enabling them to identify and address performance issues more effectively.
Shared Services Data:

Metadata search: I categorized metadata search as a platform team because it provides a foundational technology platform that can be leveraged by other teams to build data-intensive applications or services. For example, teams may use the metadata search service to search and analyze data across different sources or environments, enabling them to make better data-driven decisions.
Batch processing pipeline: I categorized batch processing pipeline as a platform team for similar reasons as metadata search. The batch processing pipeline provides a foundational technology platform that can be leveraged by other teams to process large volumes of data efficiently and reliably.
Data lake: I categorized data lake as a platform team for similar reasons as metadata search and batch processing pipeline. The data lake provides a foundational technology platform that can be leveraged by other teams to store and analyze large volumes of data, enabling them to make better data-driven decisions.

Based on the provided information, I would categorize the Cloud Team as an Enabling Team rather than a Platform Team. Here's my reasoning for each responsibility:

Authentication: This responsibility can be considered as Enabling since it provides a necessary service for other teams to build on top of, but it does not provide a platform for them to deploy their services on.

Console for a user: This can be considered Enabling, as it provides a necessary tool for users to interact with the system and consume the services provided by other teams.

External communication like alert integrations with third-party services: This can be considered Enabling, as it provides a necessary service for other teams to integrate with third-party services and perform various actions based on those integrations.

Reporting: This responsibility can be considered Enabling, as it provides a necessary tool for users to consume and analyze data generated by the other services.

Deletion protection (for entities managed by all other services): This can be considered Enabling, as it provides a necessary service to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental data loss.

User preferences for UI: This responsibility can be considered Enabling, as it provides a necessary tool for users to customize their experience while interacting with the system.

Overall, while the Cloud Team provides several services that are necessary for the successful operation of the organization, these services are not provided as a platform for other teams to build on top of. Instead, they are enabling services that facilitate the operation of other teams' services.

Based on the provided information, I would categorize Daintree as a Platform Team. Here's my reasoning:

Snapshotting filesystem: This is a platform service since it provides a foundational layer that other teams can use to implement data protection features. Other teams can use the snapshotting filesystem as a building block to create more advanced data protection solutions.

Data dumping: While this responsibility is more specific to the data protection use case, it is still a platform service since it provides a necessary capability for other teams to implement their own data protection features. For example, other teams might build backup or recovery solutions that rely on the ability to dump data to a snapshotting filesystem.

Overall, Daintree provides a platform service that other teams can build on top of to implement their own data protection features. While the service is specific to a particular use case, it still provides a foundational layer that other teams can use to create more advanced solutions.
