# Greedy Algorithms

- _Greedy Algorithms_ are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution
- Problems must exhibit two properties in order to implement a Greedy solution:
  - Optimal Substructure
    - An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the given problem's subproblems
  - The Greedy Property
    - An optimal solution is reached by "greedily" choosing the locally optimal choice without ever reconsidering previous choices
