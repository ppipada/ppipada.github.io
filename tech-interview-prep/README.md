# Introduction

> This is a step by step guide/refresher for software technical interviews.
>
> The focus is to get all things in one place to create a single, structured refresher source for programming interviews.

## What

- Information about [data structures](data-structures.md) and [algorithms](algorithms.md) basics and [coding](coding.md) is provided.
- System design section redirects to the excellent [System design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- Structured preparation steps based on different patterns.
- Recommended questions with [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) practice links.
- Ready python solutions for quick refresher
- References for exploration

## Why

- Multiple excellent interview preparation guides exist today.
- A few of these references are provided in the [external references](external.md) page.
- These resources and practice guides help a lot during the initial preparation stages where the focus is on getting coding practice and mental preparation.
- But, when a quick refresher is needed, one needs to navigate through multiple places to collect the problem statements, solutions, sequence to go about them, etc.
- This site aims to provide a solution to this problem.

## Coding problems format

- Every coding problem has tags related to data structure used, best suited algorithm, relevant pattern and difficulty level of the problem. Also a practice link to Leetcode is provided.
- Preparation can be done using different approaches based on:
  - [Difficulty levels](coding.md#difficulty-levels).
  - [Data structures](coding.md#data-structures).
  - [Algorithms](coding.md#algorithms).
  - [Patterns](coding.md#patterns).
- Recommended sequence based on each approach is provided.

## Tip

> When preparing for interviews make sure that you have PRACTICED coding using online judges like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
> This site serves as a quick refresher place rather than a practice arena.

## Pending TODO list

- Add code for basic operations of data structures.
- Add advanced data structures.
- System design interview questions and refresher.
- Tips related to behavioral round.
