Description:

- Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

Note:

- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity.
- Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

Thinking:

- We can harness the fact that XOR is its own inverse to find the missing element in linear time.
- Because we know that `nums` contains `n` numbers and that it is missing exactly one number on the range `[0..n-1][0..nâˆ’1]`, we know that nn definitely replaces the missing number in nums.
- Therefore, if we initialize an integer to nn and XOR it with every index and value, we will be left with the missing number.
