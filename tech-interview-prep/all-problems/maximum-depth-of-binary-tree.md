Description:

- Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
- The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example:

```text
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its depth = 3.
```

Note:

- A leaf is a node with no children.
