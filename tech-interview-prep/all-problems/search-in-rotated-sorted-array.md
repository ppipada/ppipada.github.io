Description:

- Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
- You are given a target value to search.
- If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
- You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
- Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
