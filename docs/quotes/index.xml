      <description>Life  Information is not knowledge
Knowledge is not wisdom
Wisdom is not truth
Truth is not beauty
Beauty is not love
Love is not music
Music is the best.
&amp;mdash; Frank Zappa
 I have this thought experiment I do in moments like that&amp;hellip;.
I imagine being nothing at all. Dead and gone.
And while being dead and gone and nothing, you were allowed to re-live just one moment again of your long lost life for a just a couple minutes and it just so happens to be the one you are in living in right now.</description>
